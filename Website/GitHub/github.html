          <ol> To fix, do:
            <li>Save working changes in other directory</li>
            <li>Delete local repository and re-download from GitHub</li>
            <li>Move your modified files back into the repo & push</li>
          </ol>
<p>
  Oftentimes, after accidentally adding a large file, the changes are still in the local .git file, and will cause continuous issues until resolved.  You can attempt to clean the working tree / stash changes aswell, but this is sometimes the most straight forward.
