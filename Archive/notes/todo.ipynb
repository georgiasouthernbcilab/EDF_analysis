    "If you plan to perform source modeling (either with EEG or combined EEG/MEG data), it is strongly recommended to use the average-reference-as-projection approach. It is important to use an average reference because using a specific reference sensor (or even an average of a few sensors) spreads the forward model error from the reference sensor(s) into all sensors, effectively amplifying the importance of the reference sensor(s) when computing source estimates. In contrast, using the average of all EEG channels as reference spreads the forward modeling error evenly across channels, so no one channel is weighted more strongly during source estimation. See also this FieldTrip FAQ on average referencing for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main reason for specifying the average reference as a projector was mentioned in the previous section: an average reference projector adapts if channels are dropped, ensuring that the signal will always be zero-mean when the source modeling is performed. In contrast, applying an average reference by the traditional subtraction method offers no such guarantee."
